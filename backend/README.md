# About This Project

The application backend is developed in Node.js and uses `express` as the web framework,`sequelize` for communication with PostgreSQL database and `jsonwebtoken` for user authentication.

Also `bee-queue` is used as a job queue using `Redis` to send emails using `node-mailer`, `handlebars` to configure each email and `Mailtrap` for testing purposes, triggered by certain events wich will be described here.

Feel free to clone this project for anything you want.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

In order to run this project you must have the following in your computer:

- Node.js v8+
- PostgreSQL (Running on default port 5432)
- Redis (Running on default port 6379)
- Mailtrap account

## Installing

**Cloning the Repository**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/passosfe/gympoint-app

$ cd gympass-app
```

**Installing dependencies**

```
$ yarn
```

_or_

```
$ npm install
```

**Docker Containers**

- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) or another setted Postgres service

First, you need to create a **.env** file in root of application. The structure of this file is similar to the **.env.example** file, just copy and put the correct informations for all variables.

### Setting database with docker compose

#### Starting postgres service with docker compose

If you dont have postgres service installed localy, you can install it with **docker compose**:

```
  ~ docker-compose up -d
```

The postgres container will be created with a user and password setted in **.env** file.

If you try create postgres service with docker compose with a local postgres service running, you will receive a error because the service is already running in the local port 5432.

You can stop postgres service in Mac with the command:

```
  ~ sudo -u postgres ./pg_ctl -D /your/data/directory/path stop
```

#### Creating and configurating database

```
  ~ yarn sequelize db:create
  ~ yarn sequelize db:migrate
  ~ yarn sequelize db:seed:all
```

## Running application

In development mode:

```
  ~ yarn dev

  ~ yarn queue:dev
```

In production mode:

```
  ~ yarn build
  ~ yarn start

  ~ yarn queue
```

# üìó Documentation

There is a file called `insomnia.json` in the root of application, that is the exported documentation of [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).
