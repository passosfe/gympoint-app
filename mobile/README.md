# About This Project

This is the mobile app of Gympoint. It is meant to be used by the students. In it the student can checkin every day he goes to the gym and see a list of all checkins he did. He can also post questions that can be answered by the system administrator at the frontend. Those questions can also be viewed within this mobile app by the student and he can see the answers posted by the administrator.

This mobile app is built using `React Native` and was built primarily for IOS but was also tested on Android to ensure the behavior was the same on both platforms.

Feel free to clone this project for anything you want.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

First, you need to create a **.env** file in root of application. The structure of this file is similar to the **.env.example** file, just copy and put the correct data for all variables.

**Please note that for the .env file, if you are using the ios simulator you can use localhost inside the url for the API. But if you are using the Android Studio emulator you must use `10.0.2.2:port` and if you are using the genymotion emulator you must use `10.0.3.2:port`**

Also make sure the backend is running. To check out how to setup the backend click [here](https://github.com/passosfe/gympoint-app/tree/master/backend).

- Emulator or USB smartphone plugged.
- React native CLI

## Installing

**Cloning the Repository**

```

## Running application

```
  ~ react-native run-ios (or run-android)

  ~ react-native start
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings

Sometimes when you try debug application with Reactotron, the app don't connect.

To fix:

```
  ~ adb reverse tcp:9090 tcp:9090
```

If you try to connect via USB, certify that you phone is connected:

```
  ~ adb devices
```

If the mobile app cannot conenct with your api even after you configurate **.env** file with the correct adrres that your api is running. You can try shake your phone, open the `Debug server host & port for device` and put your network addres and the port `8081`.
