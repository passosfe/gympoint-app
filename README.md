# ðŸ‘€ Overview

The Gympoint app is an ecosystem developed for gyms. With this app the manager can control the enrollments, subscriptions, students and answer any questions asked by their students. The web platform is for use only by the administrator, while the mobile app is for the student. In the mobile app the student can checkin every day he goes to the gym and can also create questions, and see the answers for those questions that are answered by the administrator from the web platfrorm.

# ðŸš€ Technologies and architecture

All the system was made with JavaScript using NodeJs to the server side, ReactJs to web plataform and React Native to mobile.

All knowledge aquired from the GoStack Bootcamp was used to complete this project.
